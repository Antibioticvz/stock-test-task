# Active Context

## Current Focus

Initializing the stock tracking application project structure and documentation.

## Recent Changes

- Created memory bank documentation structure
- Updated project brief with stock tracking requirements
- Defined technical stack and architecture
- Established development workflow

## Next Steps

1. Set up Next.js project with shadcn/ui
2. Configure Firebase Authentication
3. Implement stock data API integration
4. Build charting components
5. Implement alert system
6. Create API analytics dashboard

## Active Decisions

### Technology Stack

- Chose Next.js for its SSR capabilities
- Selected shadcn/ui for accessible, customizable components
- Using Firebase for authentication and hosting
- React Query for efficient data fetching

### Architecture

- App Router for better routing organization
- API routes for backend functionality
- Client-side data fetching for real-time updates

## Current Challenges

- API rate limits for stock data
- Real-time data synchronization
- Email notification delivery reliability
- Responsive chart rendering

## Important Patterns

- TypeScript strict typing
- Component-based architecture
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Proper error boundaries
- Comprehensive documentation

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branches
2. Code review before merge
3. Automated testing
4. CI/CD deployment
5. Monitoring and logging

## Notes

Ensure all code follows TypeScript best practices with no `any` types. Document all major components and decisions in the memory bank.
